You can use any provider you want. [Providers list â†’]({{< relref "extensions/list" >}})

The structure of the Consumet Extensions is not yet finalized, so changes will happen regularly.

## Books example
#### Search for a book using the libgen provider.
```js
import { BOOKS } from "@consumet/extensions"

const searchBooks = async (query) => {
  const libgen = new BOOKS.Libgen() // Class path can be found in the provider's list next to the provider name.
  const books = await libgen.search(query) // Search for books. You can see all the available methods for a object using your IDE.
  console.log(books) // Print the result.
}

searchBooks("One Hundred Years of Solitude")
```
See also the exmaples in the [extensions repository](https://github.com/consumet/extensions/tree/master/examples).

## Anime example
#### Search for an anime using the gogoanime provider.
```js
import { ANIME } from "@consumet/extensions"

const searchAnime = async (query) => {
  const gogoanime = new ANIME.GogoAnime()
  const anime = await gogoanime.search(query)
  console.log(anime)
}

searchAnime("One Piece")
```
